int a = 10;
int *p = &a;
// OR
int *p;
p = &a;
We can declare and initialize pointer at same step or in multiple line.


int a = 10;
int &p = a; // It is correct
// but
int &p;
p = a; // It is incorrect as we should declare and initialize references at single step

pointer can be reassigned as references cant be reassigned
